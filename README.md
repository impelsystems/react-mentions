# Forked from react-mentions package.

React mentions input, fork from react-mentions with some additional customisation functionality for custom add mention calls, and suggestion keyboard override.

The idea of these changes are to permit customised suggestions menus, drill-in multiple level mentions and ultimately add mentions for items that are not in the 
flat data structure supported as standard.
